Can you create a quiz game called "All About Space Modules" with the following features:
i) Make a GET request to: "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/spacecraft/?format=json", you'll get a response like this:
{

  "next": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/spacecraft/?format=json&limit=10&offset=10",
  "previous": null,
  "results": [
    {
      "id": 10,
      "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/config/spacecraft/10/?format=json",
      "name": "Apollo Command/Service Module",
      "agency": {
        "id": 999,
        "url": "https://ll.thespacedevs.com/2.2.0/agencies/999/?format=json",

        "spacecraft": "",
        "parent": "Boeing",
        "image_url": null,
        "logo_url": "https://thespacedevs-prod.nyc3.digitaloceanspaces.com/media/images/north2520american2520aviation_logo_20200711032022.png"
      },
      "in_use": false,
      "capability": "Cargo and Human Transportation to Lunar Orbit",
      "maiden_flight": "1966-02-26",

ii) You would be interested in the following properties - name, capability, crew_capacity, image_url, maiden_flight
iii) Create a quiz with 10 random elements from the array, the quiz would contain - title, progress bar, question, 4 options

v) After the answer whether right or wrong reveal more info on the space module with Capability, Crew Capacity, Maiden Flight, user presses next to move to the next question
vi) Make it space themed, use starry night images on the background: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1506318137071-a8e063b4bec0?ixlib=rb-4.0.3&ixid=MnwxMjA3fDB8MHxwaG90by1wYWdlfHx8fGVufDB8fHx8&auto=format&fit=crop&w=1470&q=80.
