I'm trying to create an interactive vocabulary game to help me study for the IELTS test. Here's what I am thinking:
1. It should be a matching game where you drag words from the left side to their definitions on the right side.
2. There should be 10 random word-definition pairs in each game from a pool of 50.
3. As you drag a word, can you highlight it somehow? Maybe change its color or make it semi-transparent?
4. When you're dragging over a potential match (a definition), can you highlight that too? Like maybe give it a green border or something?
5. Once you drop a word on a definition, can you draw a line connecting them? And keep them highlighted to show they're matched?
6. It'd be cool if you couldn't submit your answers until all words are matched.
7. After submitting, can you show which ones are right and wrong? Maybe green lines for correct matches and red for incorrect?
8. Oh, and add a restart button that shows up after you submit, so you can play again with new words.
9. Can you make it look nice too? Nothing fancy, just clean and easy to use.
10. Last thing - can you add some feedback text that guides the user? Like telling them what to do next or how they did at the end.

Do you think you could create something like that? It should all be in one HTML file so I can easily save and use it. Thanks!
