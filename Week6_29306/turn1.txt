I want to create an alchemy-based game in JavaScript. Can you implement the following:
i) The game should show 4 elements at start: Fire, Water, Earth, and Air. Each element should have a unicode symbol.
ii) Below the elements there should be 3 boxes represented like box 1 + box 2 = box 3. These boxes should be square shaped.
iii) Player can drag elements to box 1 and box 2. Box 3 would show the combined elements. Use a unicode symbol of the element.
iv) Here's a list of combinations:
Fire + Water = Steam
Fire + Earth = Lava
Air + Earth = Dust
Water + Earth = Mud
Fire + Air = Energy
Water + Energy = Life
v) Show a progress report of how many elements have been discovered, congrats the player upon finding all combinations.
vi) Make it visually appealing by centering the container, applying borders to boxes etc.
