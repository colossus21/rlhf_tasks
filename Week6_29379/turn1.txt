I want to create a game similar to Candy Crush but with colors. Can you create the following:
1. A 6x6 grid of colored cells, drag and drop functionality to swap adjacent cells. The player has to match colors.
2. Match and remove groups of 3 or more cells of the same color, either horizontally or vertically.
3. New cells should drop after cells are removed, also, chain reaction possible.
4. Add score tracking, 10 points per removed cell. Add a shuffle button below the game that shuffles colors, shuffle takes a move.
5. The player can score as much as he/she can within 20 moves. Game is over when moves run out.
