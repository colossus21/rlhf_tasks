Can you create an infinite scroller game in PhaserJS with the following:
i) The game consists of infinite scrolling tiles. Tiles with width 3 cells scroll from top to bottom.
ii) Player is a small rectangle at the second-last row from the bottom
ii) Three columns for player movement (left, center, right). Player uses arrow keys to move left and right.
iii) Start with 5 rows of all safe (blue) tiles. Then alternate the rows between 3 blue (safe) cells per row a row with 2 blue cells and 1 black cell at random column.
iv) If the player touches the black cell, game is over. Increase the game difficulty over time.
v) Display the score at the top center (based on rows survived). Show a restart button after game over (red colored).
vi) Use shapes only, no external images. Player movement should be smooth centered to tile (left, right or center).
