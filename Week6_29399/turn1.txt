Can you create a strategic 2 player board game called 'Micro Civ' with the following features:
1. The game is played on a 6x6 grid. Players take turns placing buildings: Farms (🌾), Mining Camps (⛏️), and Military (⚔️).
2. Farms produce 1 food, mining camps produce 1 gold but cost 1 food to build, and Military costs 2 food and 2 gold.
3. Military buildings control the 8 surrounding cells, preventing the opponent from building there.
4. The game ends when all cells are filled. The player with the most food wins.
5. Include a skip turn option and a way to display messages to players,
6. Use emojis or symbols for the buildings and color the players and their structures to make it easy to distinguish (i.e. prefer a red circular background for red player, blue for blue player).
7. Show tooltips to explain building costs on hovering over structure buttons. Disable structure buttons unable to built by players i.e. player has 1 foor 1 gold, disable military button etc.
8. Display current player top of the grid, turn number after that, and each player's resources below the grid. Include a restart button that appears when the game ends.
