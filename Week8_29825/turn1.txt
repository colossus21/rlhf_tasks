Create a 9x9 grid game in which 2 players can move over the board - P1 (red), P2 (blue) with the following features:
i) P1 starts top left, P2 from bottom right. Players have a goal, they have to collect 5 different shapes/emojis in a sequence.
ii) The game is turn based, player 1 moves using WASD, and player 2 using arrow keys - 1 move per turn.
iii) Spawn 12 random shapes/emojis in the board and change (10 of which are player's goals) at random positions.
iv) If a player collects the right shape, mark it as collected, if not resets the whole collection. Shuffle the positions every 10 turns.
v) Player indicator (use color for distinction) and player collections are shown above the game grid (title as well - "Shape Chasers"). Shuffle timer goes below the grid.
vi) Game ends when a player collects all 5 shapes in sequence. Show winner message and restart button.
