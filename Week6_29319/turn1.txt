Create a an endless 3D runner game named "Road Rush" using Three.js. Can you implement the following:
i) The player is a vertical cuboid character running forward automatically and can move left and right using arrow keys. Player can also jump just for the animation.
ii) The road can have textures and trees on both sides of the road.
iii) Red cubes would spawn on the roads and player must avoid it to survive.
iv) The player scores on distance traveled. The game is over if the player touches any red cubes on the road.
v) You can gradually increase difficulty by speeding up the game over time.
vi) For UI, show the game name top-left and the score below that. Make the background blue. Add a restart button after game is over.
