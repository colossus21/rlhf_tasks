Can you create a space-themed shooter game using Phaser 3 with the following features:
1. The game would be based off a 6x6 grid in which each cell is 80x80 pixels. Add a subtle grid overlay to visualize the 6x6 game area.
2. The player controls a green triangle spaceship at the bottom of the screen. It moves left and right using array keys. Presses space to shoot.
3. Enemies (red circles) spawn at the top and move downwards.
4. The player can shoot yellow bullets to destroy enemies. Bullet should spawn from the center of the triangle pointed upwards with flash effect. Red circles are destroyed by bullet impacts.
5. Implement a lives system where the player starts with 3 lives and loses one when an enemy reaches the bottom.
6. Keep track of the score which increases when enemies are destroyed. Increase difficulty with the increase of score.
7. Create an infinite scrolling star field background effect for a space atmosphere.
8. UI: display the score and remaining lives on the screen. Player loses a life if a red circle goes beyond the screen below without getting destroyed.
9. Create a game over screen when all lives are lost, with an option to restart.
10. Use no external images, only shapes. No alerts as well.
