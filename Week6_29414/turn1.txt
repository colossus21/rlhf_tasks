Can you create a game called 'Cosmic Lights Out' with the following features:
1. A 6x6 grid of lights representing stars in neonish green color.
2. Clicking a panel toggles its state and the state of up, down, left and right panels. The goal is to turn off all lights.
3. Add a move counter to track turns below the game. Add a reset button to start a new game.
4. Use a space themed background (deep blue) with scrolling stars. Center the layout.
