Create a PhaserJS game in which:
1. There would be a 8x8 grid world, bottom-left contains Start and top-right End.
2. Player moves using WASD keys, starts from 'Start' and wins the game reaching 'End' cell.
3. All cells start light blue. Unsafe cells turn orange when stepped on, then black after 1.5 seconds. It represents falling tiles.
4. Game is over if the player touches a black cell.
5. Build one safe path from start to end.
6. Show "Find the sade path!" top-center, bottom-center "Restart" button.
8. Do not use any external image for the game.
