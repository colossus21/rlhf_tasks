Can you create a 6x6 2048 inspired game called "Space Merge" with the following feature:
1. The game follows most rules of 2048. A 6x6 grid is used instead of the traditional 4x4. The player can use arrow keys for tile movement.
2. The UI should be space themed including colors of the cells and background. Add merge animations and glow effects. Occasionally spawn high-value tiles (8, 16, 32, 64, or 128) with a 10% chance, with a pulsing animation.
3. Add 3 power-ups with a 20% chance to appear after each move: Merge: Combines all tiles of a specific value, Double: Doubles a random non-empty tile and Clear: Removes 1-3 random tiles.
4. Add two buttons below the game: 'New Game' button colored #e94560 and the 'Use Power-up' button #3498db. The Use Power-up button activates the current power.
5. Above the game track current score, high score and current powerup. Player can only have 1 power up until consumed.
6. An infinite scrolling star field background created with CSS
