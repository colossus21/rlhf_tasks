Can you create this interesting game called "Periodic Table Dash", I will explain the features below:
1. The game board is basically a periodic table, each element would have atomic number and its color just like periodic table. 2 players play this game in alternating turns.
2. Players take turns rolling the dice by clicking the "Roll Dice" button. Each cell has an element.
3. Below the game there should be game info section. The element name, movement and point changes are displayed in the game info section.
4. Show at least 90 elements to complete the periodic table if not 118. Each player gains point equal to the element's atomic number per move until last cell is reached.
5. The game continues until both players reach the end of the table. One player waits if the other player has finished reaching the end of the table.
6. After game ends, show the winner and the winner's points below the game. There should be turn indicator above of the table.
