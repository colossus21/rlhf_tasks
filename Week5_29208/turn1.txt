I want to create a Roulette wheel widget in Javascript to choose a random option between multiple options, can you implement the following:
1. The widget would have a text area where the user can enter items, one per line.
2. A "Generate Wheel" button that creates the wheel using the items provided. Color the button green with white text.
3. Add a "Clear" button to reset the input and color it green as well.
4. The wheel should spin after clicking the generate wheel button.
5. Mention the selected item after the wheel is stopped. Add a pointer as well to determine which item would be picked. Keep it simple as "Selected: Item Name".
6. The whole app can have a container and centered in the page. Wheel should be added after the generate wheel button is pressed below the form.
