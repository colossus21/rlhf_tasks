Can you create a javascript game called "Emoji Recipes" in which:
i) 5x5 grid of emojis are created, and each cell in the grid contains a random emoji based on the recipes, 1 emoji per recipe item.
ii) Players can select one or more emojis by clicking on them. Selected emojis should be visually highlighted.
iii) After selecting emojis, players can press a combine button. I will provide the recipes, you will use appropriate emoji for each recipe items:
Burger bread + Tomato + Cheese = Pizza
Bread + Beef + Cheese = Hamburger
Baguette + Sausage = Hot Dog
Corn + Frying Pan = Popcorn
Lettuce + Carrot + Cucumber = Salad
Banana + Strawberry + Milk = Milkshake
Cake + Chocolate + Strawberry = Cupcake
Potato + Knife + Salt = French Fries
Ice Cream + Chocolate + Cherry = Ice Cream Sundae
Fish + Rice + Cucumber = Sushi
iv) Show a counter starting 0/10 recipe found after combine button. After each valid recipe found show feedback such as Recipe found: emoji-here. Show the discovered recipes below the grid with emoji and recipe name.
v) For invalid recipes show "No recipe found. Try again!"
vi) Show a congratulatory message right before tracking and after combine button when all recipes are found.
vii) Make the game visually appealing, center the layout. Don't use any external images or alerts.
