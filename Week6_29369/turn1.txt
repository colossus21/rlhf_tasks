Create a game called "Dot Reaction" in JavaScript in which:
i) The game has a 6x6 board.
ii) There would be 2 players - Red (P1) and Blue (P2). A player can click their pieces only. The pieces can be 1-dotted, 2-dotted and 3-dotted.
iii) However, in the first turn for each player they can place a 3-dotted piece in any cell of the board.
iv) When 1-dotted piece is clicked it becomes 2-dotted, when 2-dotted is clicked becomes 3-dotted.
When 3-dotted is clicked, pieces explodes creating 4 1-dotted pieces at top-bottom-left-right relative to that dot, if there are existing pieces on those spaces, the dots add to it rather than replacing it.
For example, a piece exploded and there's a 1-dotted piece on the left, it becomes a 2-dotted piece, if there's a 3-dotted that, that 3-dotted piece explodes.
v) After the game ends, declare the winner and ask the players if they want to play again.
vi) Make the layout nice and centered, add turn indicator above the game and add animations if required.
