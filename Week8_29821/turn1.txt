Create a 9x9 grid game called "Crystal Patterns" in which:
i) Two players take turn to put pieces (color cells) - player 1 red and player 2 blue
ii) Each player gets 3 pattern cards (3x3) with 5 filled cells.
iii) A player if he is able to match 2 patterns first wins the game. So the game checks if 2 patters are matched assigned to the player. Player 1 and Player 2 will have random 3 pattern cards.
iv) Show player indicator, score, add restart button.
v) Show a congrats message after winning, modal centered to the board. Highlight current player
vi) Patterns selected for the players should be outlined with the player's color. The pattern color should be dimmed if matched already.
