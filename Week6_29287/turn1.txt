Can you create a typing game similar using PhaserJS in which:
i) a 8x8 grid world with a car would be racing from start to end and progress upon pressing random keys. Bottom-left should have start, top-right should be end. Car should traverses all cells.
ii) There would be a 45-second timer, game ends automatically after 45 seconds.
iii) Random letters appear below the grid, preferably in a square box with the letter in white inside it.
iv) Car moves right, then up when reaching edge, then left - follows this sequence to reach end. Car can be a red rectangle, centered to the cells.
v) Show "Congratulations!" message on winning. Display typing speed in CPM at the end regardless of a win or lose.
v) Place a restart button after game over instead of the character.
vi) Make the game blue themed, blue colored cells and deep blue background. Add "Type the letters to move!" above the grid.
