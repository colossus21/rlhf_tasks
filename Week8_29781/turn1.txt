Can you create a web-based board game called 'Global Explorer' where players travel around the world with the following features:
1. Create a 6x6 grid board with each cell having the image of a different country and an event. These countries and events should be unique, each event has a point.
2. Use real country flags as icons for each space on the board. Use this url "https://flagsapi.com/:cc/flat/16.png" for flag images, :cc should be replaced by the country code.
3. 2 players take alternating turns rolling a dice and move around the board.
4. When a player lands on a cell, the player receives points and a message about a famous landmark or activity in that country.
5. Use emojis to represent playersüö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èandüö∂
6. Display a modal pop-up for 1.5 seconds when a player lands on a country, showing the event and points earned. Show current player's turn and each player's total points as well. The message should be shown below the board as well i.e. "Player 2 landed on Iceland. <some-emoji-here> Relaxed in the Blue Lagoon geothermal spa, you earn 30 points!".
7. End the game when both players reach the end of the board. Declare the winner based on who has the most points at the end.
8. Make the game visually appealing with centered.
