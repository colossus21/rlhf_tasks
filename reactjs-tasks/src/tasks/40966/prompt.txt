Make sure to use React in your response. You may use components from Shadcn using “@/components” like so: import { Card, CardContent, CardDescription, CardFooter, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"; You are not allowed to use any other dependencies or external assets.

You can define multiple sub-components if necessary, but export the final app as a default function component (export default function App()...).

Use modern React idioms like hooks.
Use Tailwind for styling.
Use prettier formatting (2-space tab width, semicolons, etc).
Ensure mobile responsiveness; the app should work with the sm breakpoint in tailwind.
Restrict your output to around 500 lines.
