I want to create an interesting game in Javascript called "Mythical Item Collector". Here are the rules:
i) The game is played by 2 players, turn based. Player 1 is blue, Player 2 is red.
ii) Each player has 5 empty boxes under his name resembling an inventory, these boxes can be empty or can have an item image (symbol).
iii) Player rolls 2 dice, then the sum is added. Player receives the item assigned to that number in the inventory.
iv) This goes on for 5 rounds until all 5 inventory slots are filled up.
v) At the end, the player receives a score sum of the cost of all the items gotten by each player. Then, declare the winner. Add a restart button as well.
vi) Add a reference list of the items above the game. Add visual feedback - Highlight the active player, animate when an item is added to inventory and highlight the acquired item in the reference list.

Here are the item names, use the symbol for inventory:
