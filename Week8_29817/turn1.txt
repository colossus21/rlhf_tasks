Can you implement this game called "Color Towers" with the following features:
i) It's a 2 players game on a 6x6 grid, divided into two sections of 3x3 grid per player.
ii) Players take turns to roll dice to get a color from 4 colors - red, blue, green, yellow and place a piece of that color in their own section i.e. pieces fall on one of the 3 columns the player has.
iii) Players can only place pieces in their own sections. Hovering over a column should highlight the column where the piece will be placed.
iv) So each piece have a color and a number, usually 1. If pieces of same color falls on same colored pieces the number increments by one. For example, if a 1 rank blue block falls on another, the blue block would have number 2 another one would make number 3.  
v) Game ends when all spaces are filled, players points are counted as the summation of the numbers of the blocks. Player with the highest sum wins the game.
vi) Make the game visually appealing with styling and animations. Place the dice below the grid. Add scores and feedback messages above the grid.
vii) Include a restart button to allow players to restart the game after it ends.
