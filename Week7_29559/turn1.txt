Can you create a puzzle game with forest theme with the following features:
1. Spawn rocks, trees and holes. Player need to cover all holes by pushing the rocks to win a level. Use emojis/symbols for player, rocks, walls and trees. Trees are not pushable.
2. Design 5 solvable levels of increasing difficulty. Congrats player after winning each level, also after completing all levels.
3. Add a visual feedback when a rock fills a hole like a green border. Player can have fade-in/out animation after each move with green background.
4. Display the current level number and move count above the game.
5. After completing each level show 'Next Level' button.
6. Provide a final congratulatory message when all levels are completed. Make the game playable with both on-screen buttons (for mobile) in addition to keyboard arrow keys.
