I want to test how MatterJS create splashes. Create a Fruit Ninja-inspired game using Matter.js, can you implement:
i) Fruits of different types and point values that are thrown from the bottom at different angles that can reach top.
ii) Player can slice those fruits by moving the mouse over them.
iii) Add a slicing effect with particles when a fruit is cut.
iv) Multiple fruits (1 to 3) spawning every half-second.
v) Show a 'Time's Up!' screen that appears when the timer reaches zero, showing the final score. Show the current score in the top-left, timer of 30 seconds.
vi) Show the high score in the top-right. Add a restart button to begin a new game after the game ends.
