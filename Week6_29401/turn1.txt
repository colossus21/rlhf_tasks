Can you create a chess-like strategy game called 'Oni Tactics' with the following:
1. Create a 5x5 grid board with the four types of units:
a) Samurai: Moves diagonally any number of spaces,
b) Ronin: Moves horizontally or vertically any number of spaces,
c) Ninja: Moves exactly 2 spaces in any direction (including diagonally),
d) Daimyo: Moves one space in any direction.
Use these symbols - 🤺 Samurai, ⚔️ Ronin, 🥷 Ninja, 👹 Daimyo, make red and blue pieces are distinguishable.
2. First row for each player is Samurai, Ronin, Daimyo, Ronin, Samurai. Second row is five Ninjas. Two players: Red (top) and Blue (bottom) play this game in turns.
3. Just like chess pieces capture by moving to an opponent's square. A player wins by capturing other player's Daimyo.
4. UI: highlight valid moves when a piece is selected or hovered. Display current player and winner announcement. Add a restart button after the game.
