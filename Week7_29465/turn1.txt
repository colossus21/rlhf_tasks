Can you create a 6x6 grid word game called 'Grid Words' where with the following features:
1. Players form words by selecting letters from the grid. Random letters should form the grid cells, common letters should be more frequent.
2. Use this API for word validation: https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>. For correct words you'll receive a response like this: "[{"word":"poolside","phonetics":[],"meanings":[{"partOfSpeech":"noun","definitions":[{"definition":"The area beside a pool.","synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]}],"synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]},{"partOfSpeech":"adjective","definitions":[{"definition":"By the side of a pool.","synonyms":[],"antonyms":[],"example":"She was sunbathing on the poolside deckchair."}],"synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]},{"partOfSpeech":"adverb","definitions":[{"definition":"Beside a pool.","synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]}],"synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]}],"license":{"name":"CC BY-SA 3.0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0"},"sourceUrls":["https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poolside"]}]"
3. For incorrect words, you'll get a 404 error if you fetch via API. So, use the API accordingly.
4. Add score based on word length. Highlight found words and making them non-reusable.
5. Add a shuffle button (top left) and an end game button to finish the game early (top right) above the grid.
6. Display of word information (phonetics/meanings) in a carousel format below the grid. This information is fetched via API.
7. When all cells are used game should be over. Display the final score and list of found words. Game should be over pressing the end game button as well. Add a restart button.
8. Use no external images, center the layout.
