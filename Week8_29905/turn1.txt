Can you create a space themed game similar to crosswords called 'Space Cross' with the following features:
1. The 6x6 board would contain blank boxes to be filled like crosswords. Words can be formed across and downwards. Letter from one word cam overlap with other.
2. The background should be starry, use blue neon blue borders. Below the game grid, divide the clues into across and down sections. Each word can have similar colors.
3. There would be 3 words - "Check Answers", "Reveal Letters (5 left)", "Forfeit". After solving the grid, player should press check answer, reveal word is a powerup that reveals a random letter and forfeit shows all the answers. Different bg colors for different buttons.
4. Use the space themed words:  ['NOVA', 'STAR', 'MOON', 'SUN', 'MARS', 'COMET', 'ORBIT', 'VENUS', 'EARTH', 'TITAN', 'NEBULA', 'GALAXY', 'QUASAR', 'METEOR', 'SATURN', 'COSMIC', 'LUNAR', 'SOLAR']
5. Use this API for clue definitions: https://api.dictionaryapi.dev/api/v2/entries/en/<word>. For correct words you'll receive a response like this: "[{"word":"poolside","phonetics":[],"meanings":[{"partOfSpeech":"noun","definitions":[{"definition":"The area beside a pool.","synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]}],"synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]},{"partOfSpeech":"adjective","definitions":[{"definition":"By the side of a pool.","synonyms":[],"antonyms":[],"example":"She was sunbathing on the poolside deckchair."}],"synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]},{"partOfSpeech":"adverb","definitions":[{"definition":"Beside a pool.","synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]}],"synonyms":[],"antonyms":[]}],"license":{"name":"CC BY-SA 3.0","url":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0"},"sourceUrls":["https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/poolside"]}]". You'll receive a 404 if words are missing in the API - use "Space-related term" for fall back.
