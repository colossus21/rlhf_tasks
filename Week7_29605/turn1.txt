Create a mystery detective game in javascript called "Murder Story" in which the detective has to find 3 hidden items: the murderer, the murder weapon and the victim's body on a 9x9 grid with the following features:
1. Clues are based on 9 items in the city each having an emoji: School, Hotel, Bank, Park, Tower, Bridge, Police Car, Fountain, Metro. Each 3x3 grid has these items at random location in one of the 9 places.
2. The player clicks on cells in the grid to uncover clues and try to find the 3 hidden items. Place a cross if the item is not there, else, highlight the item and strikethrough the clue.
3. Each hidden item can have clues i.e. Victim (use emoji) is hidden North of School (emoji), South of Hospital (emoji). Don't use same direction more than once. For all 3 items there should be 3 clues. Place the clues below the game grid.
4. Use emojis for 3 items (murderer, weapon, victim) including the landmarks.
5. If the player finds all 3 items, player wins the game, show a story in a modal such as: "Mr.X was killed by Mr.Y with a Rope. The body was found North of Hospital (emoji), the weapon was found south of Police (emoji)". The murderer, victim, weapon name can be crafted from 5 random names each.
6. Make the color and layout suitable for a mystery game. Add a new game button below the game. Also show the restart button under story.
